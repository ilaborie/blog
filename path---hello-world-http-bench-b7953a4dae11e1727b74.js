I was interested in this relative performance analysis because one of Akka HTTP’s performance goals was to catch up with Spray’s performance.</p>\n<p>If you are conducting a serious performance analysis, you would not take benchmark in this way, as my “Hello World” server was too simple and I only used a single machine to run the server and the client, which hides whether the bottleneck was on the client or the server.</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h3>akka-user discussion</h3>\n<p>There is a similiar discussion about Akka HTTP performance in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/akka-user/qhZlh0KBl2A">akka-user mailing list</a>, where the benchmark was taken using a tool called <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> against a simple serve doing hell-world json marshalling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whereas for the Akka HTTP version I saw each core using ~40% CPU throughout the test and I had the following results:\n…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">  2 threads and 100 connections\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 5.044ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 5.308ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev\n    Latency     1.83ms    1.27ms  78.91ms   95.96%\n    Req/Sec    10.55k     1.79k   28.22k    75.98%\n  5997552 requests in 5.00m, 1.00GB read\nRequests/sec:  19991.72\nTransfer/sec:      3.41MB</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>The number I foncus on this time, was <strong>req/sec: 19991.72</strong>. Of course we have to look at various characteristics of performance in more serious analsys, but this is just a starting point for now.</p>\n<h3>Spray team blog</h3>\n<p><img src="/blog/spray-bench-528d4a6d6788732badde292e0479e2a5.png" alt="spray bench"></p>\n<p>Also there is a <a href="http://spray.io/blog/2013-05-24-benchmarking-spray/">Spray team blog entry</a> which shows its performance. As it says the benchmark server was doing JSON serialization without db access, it was probably similar to the above akka-user discussion.</p>\n<p>The req/sec was 33.8K in Spray but 19.9K in Akka HTTP. So my question was,\n”<strong>how do they perform on the same machine, doing the same thing?</strong>”</p>\n<p>Maybe the difference in their performance was due to the difference on the machines the benchmark was run, and probably because the code of one experiment was bit more complicated than the other.</p>\n<h2>My Bencmarking setup</h2>\n<p>I set up a very, very simple HTTP server in both in Akka HTTP and Spray, where the Spray one was inspired by its <a href="https://github.com/spray/spray-template">official template</a>.</p>\n<h3>Akka HTTP</h3>\n<p><a

We have to keep in mind that the benchmark results are specific to the setup, including machines you run the bench, the server implementation and what kind of work the server does, latency and throughput between components if there are multiple components involved, etc.</p>\n<p>Also, what “realistic” benchmark actually means depends on what your target application (web server) is. We have to pay attention that the difference between application’s production environment and the benchmark environment.</p>\n<p>Although having realistic setup, close to your production environment is important, another thing to note is that there is no one-size-fits-all benchmark method. Like anything else in software engineering, you should have differnt tooling for different aspects of benchmarking. You might think that if you make the benchmark environment as close as your production environment, you will get the most accurate results and that’s it. However, that way, you cannot identify which component is the bottleneck of the performance when you see your entire application’s performance is not satisfactory. You need more granular results from different parts of the system.</p>\n<p>That is why I did this very simple, ridiculously simple benchmarking. This didn’t give us any realistic performance figure which we can guess the production performance from, but it gave me a sense on maximum possible performance of Akka HTTP web server. (Actually, better experiment is to run the client and the server on different machines though.)</p>\n<p>By testing each component individually, also testing in small groups of components, you will then realize the performance cap of each part of your entire application. Comparing that with your benchmark agains the whole application system, you will be able to figure out what is the bottleneck, and what part of the application is not scaling as you would have expected.</p>\n<p>So I am going to write up other articles to cover these aspects to show procedure on performing (web) application performance testing, and hopefully micro benchmarking internals of akka application/service too.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Benchmarking Spray and Akka HTTP Hello World servers",date:"March 03, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/hello-world-http-bench/"}}}});
