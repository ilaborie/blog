## We started doing OSS Hackathon regularly

The last Sunday was a pretty exciting day for me.

We started a new community to run OSS Hackathon events regularly, and the last Sunday, May 27th
was the first occurrence of the hackathon events.

A small group eight attendees and three OSS maintainers worked on their favorite OSS projects,
and the attendees tried to contribute to the projects with help from the maintainers.

The maintainers who helped the hackathon were:

 - [@ko_noike](https://twitter.com/ko_noike), a [GitBucket](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket) maintainer
 - [@seratch](https://twitter.com/seratch), the creator of [ScalikeJDBC](https://github.com/scalikejdbc) and [SkinnyFramework](https://github.com/skinny-framework)
 - [@xuwei-k](https://twitter.com/xuwei_k), maintainer of [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz), [argonaut-io](https://github.com/argonaut-io), [ScalikeJDBC](https://github.com/scalikejdbc), @[unfiltered](https://github.com/unfiltered), etc and creator of [scalaprops](https://github.com/scalaprops), [msgpack4z projects](https://github.com/msgpack4z)

where [@seratch](https://twitter.com/seratch) and [@xuwei-k](https://twitter.com/xuwei_k) joined remotely via Slack.

Special thanks to the maintainers!!

## The OSS Hackathon community was born out of ScalaMatsuri

We decided to do this OSS Hackathon regularly because we already had a similar hackathon event
in the pats as part of ScalaMatsuri 2018, and received a great amount of positive feedback both from the attendees and the OSS maintainers.

After ScalaMatsuri OSS Hackathon, there were several people who showed interest in running such OSS Hackathon events in a monthly or bi-monthly basis,
we formed up a new community focused on this effort.

## The outcome of the event

It was a four-hour long event

Some feedback from the attendees were:

- Appreciate quick help from the OSS maintainers
- It would have been even better if there was more introduction in advance about basics in how to contribute to OSS, how to pick issues, etc
- Interesting to find that each OSS project has different culture and policies in test requirements, code reviews, etc
- I worked on a seemingly-easy issue but it turned out difficult and tedious!
- Good opportunity to get focused on just for contribution, for four hours long
- Advice on writing pull request description was useful

##

- Include more OSS maintainers, and OSS contributors who can help aspiring contributors
- Remote hackathon via Slack or Google Hangout,
- Hold hackathon in a more European or US friendly time zone
- Shift timezone startegy - prepare list -> Tokyo does hackathon -> maintainers give feedback
- to make this as more continuous event - hackathon is an entry point
